console.log("ALL YOUR "+process.argv[2]+" ARE BELONG TO "+process.argv[3]);
/*

To get into the rhythm, let's do a simple hello world.

Write a Node program that accepts two command-line arguments, X and
Y and prints out to the console the following text:

  ALL YOUR X ARE BELONG TO Y

When you have completed your program, you can run it in the test
environment with:

  levelmeup run program.js

And once you are happy that it is correct then run:

  levelmeup verify program.js

And your submission will be verified for correctness. After you have
a correct solution, run `levelmeup` again and select the next problem!

 » To print these instructions again, run: `levelmeup print`.
 » To execute your program in a test environment, run:
   `levelmeup run program.js`.
 » To verify your program, run: `levelmeup verify program.js`.
 » For help with this problem or with levelmeup, run:
   `levelmeup help`.
